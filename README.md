Idea:
    on keys 1-4 different attacks based on sword
        -> cooldown, damage, animation
    
    have to hit right one -> counters, spiderman like senses.

    5 Pillars (Character): 
        - speed
        - sensing -> longer counter windows
        - strength -> damage
        - hp
        - armor
        - stamina

        -> Different Characters + different swords = different builds

    Pillars (swords):
        - cooldown
        - sharpness -> damage
        - heavyness -> interrupting enemies
        - blocking
        - pariing
        - dodging


    +1 of 3 random stats per round, rerolls
    shop every 5 to 10 rounds

    more enemies per round
    bosses -> longer windows, more dmg and hp

    meta progression -> swords /characters /items /moves
